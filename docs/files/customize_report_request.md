## The purpose of business reporting

\
The aim of a business report is to provide critical analysis of how the business is tracking in all areas of the organization. Business reports are important tools to guide decision-making and to allow business owners and senior managers the opportunity to investigate and solve any identified issues.

\
Reporting is done through the process of compiling and reviewing the information within a specific functional area such as finance, sales, operations, inventory control or any area of the business where performance is monitored and measured.

\
Once information is gathered and reviewed, conclusions can then be drawn and recommendations made. The outcome of the report may explain why an issue has occurred or may identify performance problems and generally will recommend a course of action.
