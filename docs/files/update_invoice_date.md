*The invoice date cannot be upadted while editing the invoice*. Main reason for this restriction is, most of our clients don't want their biller to edit the invoice date. In case if he made any mistake, he should request to the responsible person to get this updated. 

To achive this, we have added a menu as below. **The access to this menu can be controlled from User group**. So admin can control, who can change the invoice date and who is responsible for this change.

> Please note that, the date update is restricted to the date of relative invoice. 
> 
> *That means, you cannot change the date of an invoice to a day before the date of its previous invoice. Similarly, you are not allowed to change the date to any day after the date of its next invoice*
