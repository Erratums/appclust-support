 6. If you missed any mandatory fields, it will be highlighted in red color. You cannot leave such fields empty
### Sub Items Section
There is a **Sub Items** **Section**. This is useful when you need to sell multiple items as single product or combo. 1 example is garment industry. You can add Cloth [in length], Buttons, zipper, Packing box etc. as sub items and sell as a Single product Shirt or Pants. When you add such items to invoice, it'll subtract respective quantity from the main item. Let's say you added 1.5 meter cloth to an item shirt, once you add it to invoice, IMS will subtract 1.5 meter quantity from the main item cloth. Similarly IMS will calculate the quantity of shirt from the quantity of the sub items.
